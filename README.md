# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
This project transforms data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository into an interactive dashboard. Users can explore the data visually on maps and through other visualizations built with Python libraries (Pandas, Streamlit, Plotly). The data is stored efficiently in a MySQL database for quick retrieval and dynamic updates within the dashboard.

This project aims to create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard to visualize and explore data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

Problem states that:
The PhonePe Pulse repository holds a wealth of data on various metrics and statistics.This project addresses the challenge of extracting, processing, and presenting this data in a user-friendly way.

The project will follow a six-step approach:
Data Extraction: Scripting will be used to clone the PhonePe Pulse repository and store the data in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.
Data Transformation: Python and libraries like Pandas will be used to clean, manipulate, and prepare the data for analysis and visualization.
Database Insertion: The "mysql-connector-python" library will connect to a MySQL database to store the transformed data efficiently.
Dashboard Creation: Streamlit and Plotly libraries will be used to create an interactive dashboard.
Plotly's geo map functionality will display data geographically.
Streamlit will provide a user interface with dropdowns for users to select specific data to visualize.
Data Retrieval: The "mysql-connector-python" library will again be used to connect to the MySQL database and fetch data dynamically for the dashboard.
Deployment: The solution will be secured, efficient, and user-friendly. After thorough testing, the dashboard will be deployed publicly for access.

Benefits:
Users will explore PhonePe Pulse data through an interactive, visually appealing geo dashboard.
At least 10 dropdown options will allow users to customize the data displayed.
Storing data in a MySQL database ensures efficient retrieval and updates.
Web browser accessibility makes the dashboard readily available.

This workflow provides a detailed roadmap for building your PhonePe Pulse data visualization dashboard. 

*Workflow of the code:
Import Libraries: Necessary libraries for data manipulation, database connection, web app creation, and potentially data processing, file handling, database interaction, data presentation and image handling are imported.
Connect to MySQL Database: The script connects to a MySQL database named "phonepe_pulse" using credentials and creates a cursor object to interact with it.
Configure Streamlit App: The app layout is set to "wide" and divided into three tabs: "Explore Data," "Insights," and "About" (likely empty in this code).
"Explore Data" Tab Selected: The code checks if the "Explore Data" tab is active.
Switch to phonepe_pulse Database: The cursor uses the USE statement to switch to the relevant database.
User Input for Data Type: User selects data type ("Transactions" or "Users") from a dropdown menu.
User Input for Year: User selects a year (2018-2023) from another dropdown menu.
User Input for Quarter: User selects a quarter (1-4) from a third dropdown menu.
Convert User Inputs to Integers: The script converts the chosen year and quarter from strings to integers for use in the SQL query.
Construct SQL Query: Based on user selections, a SQL query is built to retrieve aggregated transaction data (count, total amount, average) from a table named agg_t for the chosen year and quarter.
Execute SQL Query: The constructed SQL query is executed on the database using the cursor.
Fetch Query Results: The results of the executed query are retrieved and stored.
Display Transaction Statistics: Success/info messages are displayed for total transactions, total payment value, and average transaction value based on the retrieved data.
Create Additional Columns: Two more columns are created in the Streamlit layout.
Construct Another SQL Query: A new SQL query is built to find the sum of transaction amounts grouped by state for the chosen year and quarter.
Execute Second SQL Query: This second query is executed on the database using the cursor.
Convert Results to DataFrame: The retrieved results are converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
Standardize State Names: State names in the DataFrame are mapped to a dictionary to ensure consistent formatting.
Prepare Visualization : A variable fig is created, likely intended to hold a visualization (potentially a chart) for transaction distribution across states. However, the code for populating it with data is missing.
(Potential) Display Visualization: The visualization created using fig would likely be displayed on the Streamlit app (assuming the code to populate it is added).
This workflow summarizes the key steps of the code, highlighting user interaction, database interaction, data processing, and potential visualization.
