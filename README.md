# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
This project transforms data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository into an interactive dashboard. Users can explore the data visually on maps and through other visualizations built with Python libraries (Pandas, Streamlit, Plotly). The data is stored efficiently in a MySQL database for quick retrieval and dynamic updates within the dashboard.
